I have two laptops. One, which I bring with me to the Univeristy, and another that I leave at home. In order for me to sync the work I'm doing between the two computers I needed something simple. 

Here are the several solutions I examined:

Github
This is mainly used for code, but would have been great for keeping track of file history. Based on their website, there are soft space limits and it seems to imply that the service shouldn't be used for backup.

Dropbox
One of the most common synchronization and sharing tools available, Dropbox is easy to use. One of the downsides though is that it doesn't have the encryption and privacy that SpiderOak has.

SpiderOak
SpiderOak was ultimately chosen, because it provides encryption. It's more expensive and the free quota is much lower. However, if I exclude a lot of the bigger files such as /Downloads then it should be plenty.
